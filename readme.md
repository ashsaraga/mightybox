## Quick Overview

MightyBox is a custom built Vagrant box that uses the LAMP stack on Ubuntu 16.04 and the WordPress CLI to create a mobile WordPress instance.  Databases are imported and exported on `vagrant up` and `vagrant halt` respectively.

This repo also includes scripts for automated server setup through DigitalOcean's API and a custom Droplet image.
